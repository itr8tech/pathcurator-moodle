    "headerImage": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAB...",
    "contentWarning": "Optional warning text shown in collapsible section",
    "steps": [
      {
        "name": "Step 1: Getting Started",
        "objective": "What students will accomplish in this step",
        "bookmarks": [
          {
            "title": "Required Reading",
            "url": "https://example.com/reading",
            "description": "Essential content description",
            "type": "Required",
            "contentType": "Article",
